        <p class="content">I started programming in 5th grade and have been teaching myself more and more over the last 6 years. The more I learned, the more things I found that I could do myself, which in turn motivated me to learn more. The programming languages I use the most are C++, Python, Javascritp, HTML, SQL and CSS.<br><br>Over time I have also started to participate in some programming competitions and programs to see what I can do but also to share knowledge with others and learn from each other. Most of my projects I start out of self-initiative and interest in certain topics. In fact, this website is one of my most recent projects.<br><br>The best thing about programming for me is that there are no limits to what you can do. It's a question of how much ambition and motivation you put into it!</p>
